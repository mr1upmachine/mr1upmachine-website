## Tools

- large stock pot (4-6qt)
- casserole pan / pyrex oblong baking dish

## Ingredients

- 2 large eggs
- 1 12oz can evaporated milk
- 1 teaspoon dry mustard
- 1 teaspoon vinegar based hot sauce
- 8oz elbow macaroni (2 cups)
- 4 tbsp unsalted butter
- 12 oz sharp cheddar shredded cheese
- Salt
- Pepper (to taste)

### Baked Topping (optional)

- ~1 cup parmesan cheese

## Steps

1. Mix eggs, 1 cup of the evaporated milk, mustard, a pinch of salt, pepper, and hot sauce in a bowl
2. Bring 2 quarts of water to a boil
3. Add pasta & salt to the water and cook
4. Drain pasta and return it to the pot on low heat
5. Add butter to the pot and stir until fully melted
6. Add egg mixture and ¾ of the cheese. Stir until thoroughly combined.
7. Gradually add the remaining evaporated milk & cheese until thoroughly combined

### Baked Topping (optional)

8. Pour the above into a 13in x 9in broiler safe baking pan
9. Add a layer of parmesan cheese on top of the mac
10. Broil until toppings are melted & a golden brown

## Notes

-. It’s best if you use two different kinds of cheese in the mac. I prefer using ⅔ cheddar & ⅓ smoked gouda.

- Hot sauce should be something generic like Franks Red Hot, Texas Pete, Cholula, or Valentina
