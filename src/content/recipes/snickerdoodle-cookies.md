## Equipment 

- oven
- baking sheet
- whisk
- 2 mixing bowls

## Ingredients

- 1⅓ cups (160g) all-purpose flour
- ½ cup (100g) softened, unsalted butter
- ¾ cup (150g) granulated sugar
- 1 egg
- 1 tsp vanilla
- 1 tsp cream of tartar
- ½ tsp salt
- ¼ tsp baking soda

### Coating

- 2 tbsp sugar
- 1 tbsp ground cinnamon

(Makes about a dozen cookies)

## Steps

1. Add the flour, salt, baking soda, and cream of tartar to a bowl, and whisk to combine.
2. In another mixing bowl, whip the softened butter with the sugar until very fluffy.
3. Add the egg and vanilla to the butter/sugar and whip to combine.
4. Add in the dry ingredients from the first bowl and whip to combine.
5. Prepare the coating by mixing about one part cinnamon to two parts sugar. (Usually 1 tbsp cinnamon and 2 tbsp sugar is enough, but feel free to make more and save the extra for another time).
6. Roll the dough into ~1½ inch balls.
7. Roll each dough ball around in the coating, set them on a parchment-lined baking sheet, and then slightly flatten each ball into a thick puck.
8. Bake at 375ºF/190ºC (convection, ideally) for 8-9 minutes.

## Notes

- Be careful not to overbake these or they will be hard when cooled. Wait until they start to spread and crack, and watch the raw dough exposed by the crack — when it just barely doesn't look wet anymore, that's a good sign they're done.
