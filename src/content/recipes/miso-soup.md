## Tools

- Small pot (1.5qt)

## Ingredients

- 4 cups water
- 3 tsp [bonito soup stock](https://a.co/d/fnFTv68)
- 3 tbsp [miso paste](https://proshop.prontohomedelivery.com/product/miso-soybean-paste-2?srsltid=AfmBOore-E0IlBe4zYCt6HULX3R-ntc-bc0-ROk9FXbYP2waNYfJKKj3eSI&gQT=1)

## Steps

1. Add bonito soup stock & water to the pot and to a low boil.
2. Add miso paste and stir. It should dissolve with the boiling water alone but stir if need be.
3. Let simmer for 5 minutes.
4. Serve in a cup to sip with a utensil for stirring before each sip.

## Notes

- There are a LOT of varieties of miso paste. They all should work but will cause this to taste radically different. I linked my personal favorite in the ingredients but you might be limited by whatever is available to you. Check your local Asian grocery store.
