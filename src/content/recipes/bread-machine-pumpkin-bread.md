## Equipment

- bread machine
- food scale

## Ingredients

The following is for a 2lb loaf. For other sizes, simply adjust the ratio of ingredients up or down.

### Bread

- 150g or 3 large eggs, beaten
- 72g (approx. 80mL) vegetable oil
- 5g (1 tsp) vanilla extract
- 240g (1 cup) canned pumpkin puree
- 103g (1/2 cup) sugar
- 2.5g (1/2 tsp) salt
- 260g (2 cups) all purpose flour
- 9g (3 tsp) baking powder
- 5.5g (1 tsp) baking soda
- 4g (2 tsp) pumpkin pie spice
- 2g (1 tsp) ground cinnamon

### Mixins

- 72g (2/3 cup) walnuts, cut into 1/4‚Äù (6mm) pieces (optional)


## Steps

1. Add all "Bread" ingredients to the bread machine ***in the order specified***
2. Set the bread machine to the "sweet"/"cake" setting or whatever equivalent
3. When your bread machine prompts you to add mixins (usually beeping), use a silicone spatula to scrape any excess flour off the sides.
4. Add all of the mixins

## Notes


- You can sub half of the walnuts for raisins if you prefer that
- The reason for adding the ingredients in a specific order is because you want wet ingredients to go in first, then flour to create a buffer, then the dry ingredients.
- I own [this bread machine](https://shop.zojirushi.com/products/bbpdc?srsltid=AfmBOorG05ksR-_dPSJdPvuBO4suYH_pXgjQGTmibHCmjegY4xhBfNh6) and this recipe was tested with it. You *should* be able to make a 2lb loaf with this recipe but you might need to adjust accordingly.
