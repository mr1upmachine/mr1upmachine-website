## Equipment

- oven
- baking sheet
- mixing bowl

## Ingredients

- 8 tbsp (1 stick) unsalted butter
- 180g granulated sugar
- ~7-10g molasses
- 1 egg
- 1 tsp vanilla
- 1 tap salt
- ½ tsp baking soda
- 1-1½ cups (~125-175g) all purpose flour
- 10oz bag of chocolate chips

(Makes about a dozen cookies)

## Steps

1. Measure out the sugar in a large bowl.
2. Melt the butter. Optionally, you can brown the butter.
3. Pour the melted butter over the sugar and beat it with a mixer until thoroughly mixed.
4. Add the molasses and mix.
5. Add the egg and vanilla and mix.
6. Add the salt and baking soda and mix.
7. Start with adding about 125g/1 cup flour and mix, then slowly add and mix more flour until it gets a semi-solid consistency. It shouldn’t be too runny and should pull away from your fingers relatively easily.
8. Add chocolate chips and mix.
9. Place the dough in the fridge for at least 30 minutes to harden.
10. Take the dough out, turn the oven broiler on, and make sure one of the oven grates is second from the top.
11. Place 2 sheets of parchment paper on baking sheets.
12. Scoop the dough into balls 1½-2 inches across, placing 6 dough balls per sheet.
13. Flatten the balls into pucks.
14. Place one tray at a time in the oven under the broiler for about 45 seconds, make sure to watch so they don’t burn.
15. Repeat the broiling for as many sheets of cookies that you have.
16. Set the oven to 350F, wait for the heat to evenly distribute even if the temperature beeper goes off.
17. Bake the cookies for 10 minutes, swapping sheets between top/bottom grates halfway through if your oven cooks unevenly.
18. Enjoy!
