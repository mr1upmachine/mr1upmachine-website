## Equipment

- bread machine
- food scale

## Ingredients

The following is for a 2lb loaf. For other sizes, simply adjust the ratio of ingredients up or down.

- 320g (1¼ cups) water
- 24g (2 tbsp) olive oil
- 553g (~4¼ cups) bread flour
- 36g (3 tbsp) sugar
- 10g (2 tbsp) salt
- 3g (1 tbsp) dried oregano
- 3g (1 tbsp) dried parsley
- 3g (1 tbsp) dried rosemary
- 6g (2 tbsp) rapid rise yeast / bread machine yeast

## Steps

1. Add all ingredients to the bread machine ***in the order specified***
2. Set the bread machine to the "white" setting


## Notes

- Feel free to mess with the herb ratios. I prefer heavy herb usage
- The reason for adding the ingredients in a specific order is because you want wet ingredients to go in first, then flour to create a buffer, then the dry ingredients, finally yeast at the very top. This prevents the yeast from accidentally being killed too early in the process
- I own [this bread machine](https://shop.zojirushi.com/products/bbpdc?srsltid=AfmBOorG05ksR-_dPSJdPvuBO4suYH_pXgjQGTmibHCmjegY4xhBfNh6) and this recipe was tested with it. You *should* be able to make a 2lb loaf with this recipe but you might need to adjust accordingly.
