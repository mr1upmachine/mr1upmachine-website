## Equipment

- bread machine
- food scale

## Ingredients

The following is for a 2lb loaf. For other sizes, simply adjust the ratio of ingredients up or down.

- 320g (1¼ cups) cold water (41°F / 5°C)
- 60g (3 tbsp) honey
- 35g (2½ tbsp) unsalted butter, softened or mostly melted
- 553g (~4¼ cups) bread flour
- 10g (2 tbsp) salt
- 6g (2 tbsp) rapid rise yeast / bread machine yeast

## Steps

1. Add all ingredients to the bread machine ***in the order specified***
2. Set the bread machine to the "white" setting and press start


## Notes

- The reason for adding the ingredients in a specific order is because you want wet ingredients to go in first, then flour to create a buffer, then the dry ingredients, finally yeast at the very top. This prevents the yeast from accidentally being killed too early in the process
- I own [this bread machine](https://shop.zojirushi.com/products/bbpdc?srsltid=AfmBOorG05ksR-_dPSJdPvuBO4suYH_pXgjQGTmibHCmjegY4xhBfNh6) and this recipe was tested with it. You *should* be able to make a 2lb loaf with this recipe but you might need to adjust accordingly.
