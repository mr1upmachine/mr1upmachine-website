## Tools

- Large blender
- Stock pot
- Sheet pan

## Ingredients

- 5 poblano peppers
- 1 onion
- 4 garlic cloves
- 3 tbsp butter
- 3 tbsp all purpose flour
- 4 cups chicken bone or vegetable broth
- 2 tsp oregano
- pinch of cumin
- Â½ tsp salt (plus more to taste)

### For the garnish (optional)

- finely chopped cilantro
- Mexican Crema (or heavy cream)
- [Valentina](https://www.kroger.com/p/valentina-mexican-hot-sauce/0009733900005) or [Cholula](https://www.kroger.com/p/cholula-original-hot-sauce/0004973309101) hot sauce

## Steps

1. Rinse the poblanos and roast them in the oven at 425F. Give them a flip after 15 minutes. They'll be mostly roasted in another 10-15 minutes, so 25-30 minutes total roasting time in the oven.
2. Add all butter to the stock pot on medium heat. Roughly chop an onion and add it to the saucepan, cooking for 5-7 minutes or until softened.
3. Mince 4 garlic cloves and add to the onion, cooking for a minute or so.
4. Add flour to the onion mixture and combine well.
5. Add broth, oregano, cumin, salt, and black pepper. Stir well. Simmer for 7-8 minutes.
6. Once the poblano peppers have cooled a bit, pull off as much skin as you can but don't worry about getting rid of all of it. Then de-stem and de-seed the poblanos. Roughly chop the poblano pieces and add them to the pot.
7. Cook until everything is at a uniform temp and then combine the mixture in a blender. Be sure to use caution when blending hot liquids -- I usually just hold a paper towel over any openings just in case you get a geyser.
8. Return mixture to the pot and simmer for 10 more minutes.
9. Serve immediately with optional garnish don't forget to garnish! I used Crema, finely chopped cilantro stems, freshly ground pepper, and more than a couple dashes of Valentina hot sauce.
10. Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge.

## Notes

- The acidity of the hot sauce pairs well with the poblanos so feel free to re-garnish once you make your way through the top layer. Other options for acidity: lemon/lime juice or vinegars.
