## Tools

- Medium-sized saucepan
- 9x13" dish

## Ingredients

### Filling

- 2 (3.4 oz) boxes vanilla instant pudding
- 2½ cups milk
- 1 (8 oz) container Cool Whip (or 3 c. homemade whipped cream)
- 1 (14.4 oz) box graham crackers

### Chocolate Topping

- ⅓ cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- ¼ cup milk
- ½ cup butter (1 stick)
- 1 tsp vanilla extract

## Steps

### Prepare the filling

1. Combine dry pudding mix and w½ cups milk; beat until well mixed. Stir in Cool Whip.
2. Place a layer of graham crackers in the bottom of a 9x13" dish.
3. Spread ½ of the pudding mixture over the graham crackers. Repeat with another layer of graham crackers and pudding; then top with a final layer of graham crackers.

### Prepare the chocolate topping

1. In a medium-sized saucepan, bring cocoa, milk, and sugar to a full rolling boil; boil about 1 minute, stirring very frequently.
2. Remove from heat and cool one minute. Add butter and vanilla; stir until butter is melted.
3. Pour chocolate topping over the top layer of graham crackers. Spread evenly to completely cover graham crackers.
4. Cover dessert and refrigerate over night.

## Notes

- Keep in mind when making this must chill overnight to set and allow the layers to meld.
- When making the chocolate topping, be sure to let the mixture come to a full rolling boil. Otherwise, it will stay too soft and runny on top of the dessert -- rather than setting into a nice fudgy layer.
