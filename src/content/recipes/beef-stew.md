## Equipment

- Large pot

## Ingredients

- 1kg beef chunks - Stew cut preferred
- 3-5 (~450g) gold potatoes
- 300g carrots
- 3-5 (~600g) yellow onions
- 7 garlic cloves, minced
- 2 cups beef stock
- 3 cups red wine (Hierarchy of best to worst for this recipe is Pinot Noir > Merlot > Cabernet Sauvignon)
- 2 cups water
- 1 6oz can tomato paste
- ½ ketchup
- ½ cup balsamic vinegar
- 2 tbsp rosemary
- flour (Enough to coat the beef chunks in flour and pan sear them)
- 2 tbsp salt
- pepper to taste
- sugar to taste
- 2 tbsp parsley
- 2 tbsp olive oil

## Steps

1. Heat up a large pot and add olive oil.
2. Chop the potatoes and carrots.  Wash, then set them aside.
3. Chop onions and mince garlic.
4. Coat the beef with pepper, salt, and flour, making sure it's spread pretty evenly.
5. Toss in chopped onions and garlic and cook until onions begin browning (this need to happen simultaneously with meat prep in next step).
6. Once these have started browning, add the beef mix.
7. Cook until meat is sufficiently browned.
8. Add in the tomato paste and mix.  Allow to cook a bit.
9. Add in the wine, beef broth, and water.
10. Cover and let simmer on low-medium for a while.  Stir occasionally and ensure meat doesn't burn to bottom of the pot.
11. This step takes about 2 hours, but you're trying to reduce the alcohol in the wine.  Adjust heat as necessary.
12. Once successfully reduced, you may add the potatoes and carrots.
13. Continue cooking on low-medium for about an hour, again, stirring occasionally.  The potatoes must not melt due to heat, but must be firm by completion.
14. Once the potatoes and carrots are able to be cut through nicely with a work, it's done!
