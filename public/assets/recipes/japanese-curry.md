# Japanese Curry

## Tools

- Medium / large stock pot (6 quart)
- Pressure Cooker

## Ingredients

- ~1lb chicken breast
- 1 curry mix packet (I prefer Vermont Curry)
- 1 large onion, diced
- 2-3 large potatoes, cubed, skin optional
- 2 green apples, cubed
- 1 carrot, peeled & cubed
- 1 bell pepper, sliced into strips
- 1 jalapeno, diced (seeds optional)
- 1 tsp curry powder
- 1 tsp ginger powder
- 1.5 tbsp honey
- 2 cups chicken bone broth
- Â¼ cup soy sauce
- 1.5 tsp sesame oil
- White rice
- Water

## Steps

If you have a rice cooker, start it before cooking the curry. If you are making rice on the stove, then prepare it during step 7.

1. Add chicken and a little water into the pressure cooker
2. Pressure cook the chicken for 10 minutes.
3. Take chicken out of pressure cooker and shred as much as possible
4. Saute onions, bell pepper, apples, ginger powder, and curry powder in the sesame oil in a stock pot. Cook them until onions are translucent & apples are soft.
5. Add chicken broth to the pot and scrape up any parts that have stuck to the pan (do not remove)
6. Add shredded chicken, leftover water from the pressure cooker, potatoes, carrots, honey, soy sauce to the pot. Liquid should sit about a centimeter above ingredients.
7. Turn heat up to medium high and boil everything together until potatoes & carrots are soft enough to eat. Stir frequently.
8. Reduce heat to low and add curry mix. Stir until fully melted into the broth.
9. Cook all ingredients together for at least 15 minutes on low, stirring occasionally. It can be cooked longer.
10. Serve with rice.

## Notes

- Makes way too much. Have several food storage containers for leftovers ready. I recommend portioning 1:1 curry & rice
- This recipe can be put in the fridge / freezer and reheats wonderfully in the microwave. When reheating add a splash of water over the rice before microwaving if rice is stored with the curry.
- If you don't have a pressure cooker, get one. But in the meantime, you can cook the chicken on the stovetop. Simply boil the chicken in the chicken broth mentioned above and shred / chop it once fully cooked.

  - "Hot" is not spicy at all I promise
