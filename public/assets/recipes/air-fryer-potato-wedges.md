# Air Fryer Potato Wedges

## Tools

- Air Fryer

## Ingredients

- 1 medium or 2 small potatoes (~325g)
- ½ tsp olive oil
- 1 tbsp dried parsley
- ½ tsp paprika
- ½ tsp garlic powder
- Salt (to taste)
- Pepper (to taste)

## Steps

1. Preheat the air fryer to 400 ℉
2. Chop potatoes into small wedges. Size / shape isn’t important, but aim for no bigger than a cubic inch.
3. Place chopped potatoes in a medium bowl. Add olive oil, parsley, paprika, garlic powder, and pepper to the bowl with the potatoes and toss thoroughly. Everything should be fully coated.
4. Put tossed potatoes into the air fryer and cook at 400 ℉ for 15 minutes. Halfway through make sure to toss them in the basket for even cooking.
5. When cooking is complete, open the basket and immediately toss salt onto them.

## Notes

- I typically use gold or russet potatoes but this works with any type
- For the olive oil I typically eyeball it. ½ tsp is likely an overestimation, as I aim to use as little as possible
